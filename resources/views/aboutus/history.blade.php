                                    The <b>Integrated Computer Society (ICS)</b> was established in <b>2019</b> at <b>Navotas Polytechnic College</b> as the official student organization for the <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)</b> program. It was created to unite students who share a passion for technology and computing, offering a platform for learning, collaboration, leadership, and innovation. From its early years, ICS has aimed to provide opportunities for students to enhance their technical skills, engage in meaningful projects, and build a strong sense of community within the field of computer science.</p>

                                    In <b>2022</b>, when the BSCS program was officially phased out and replaced with the <b>Association in Information Systems (AIS)</b> program, ICS continued its journey as the recognized organization for information systems students. Despite the changes in academic programs, the organization remained steadfast in its mission and values, adapting to the evolving needs of the students while maintaining its core purpose of promoting growth, excellence, and leadership in the tech community.
